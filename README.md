# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Erlisja Kore**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**NASA photo of the Day** is an android app that **shows the picture of the day using NASA's API, APOD(Astronomy Photo of the Day), which is one of the most popular websites of NASA. This app also 
allows user to browse photos from the previous days one by one or enter a specific date and see the photo of that day. For each image dispalyed the user can see the title of this pic and a description
provided for that photo**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **<3 <3 <3**
